No, V-Dem data does NOT show an improvement in democracy in Spain. In fact, Spain just received its worst score in 40 years.
================

The V-Dem data
==============

[V-Dem](https://www.v-dem.net/en/) is an international academic consortium, based at the University of Gothenburg (Swedem), that measures democracy. Its annual ["Democracy Report"](https://www.v-dem.net/en/news-publications/democracy-reports/) is a reliable barometer of the democratic quality of different countries - across multiple dimensions and indicators - around the world. Unlike some indices of democracy, V-Dem's methods and data are completely transparent and available; anyone can [download the data](https://www.v-dem.net/en/data/data-version-9/) and examine each variable by herself.

Spain and the 2019 report
=========================

V-Dem recently published its [2019 report](https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/99/de/99dedd73-f8bc-484c-8b91-44ba601b6e6b/v-dem_democracy_report_2019.pdf) and [raw data](https://www.v-dem.net/en/data/data-version-9/). Soon after publication, the Spanish Government marketing arm, [Global Spain](https://espanaglobal.gob.es/en) (a branch of the Spanish Government's [Ministry of Foreign Affairs](http://www.exteriores.gob.es/Portal/en/PoliticaExteriorCooperacion/MarcaEsp/Paginas/inicio.aspx)) began tweeting data and infographics based on V-Dem.

These tweets and charts, in both English and Spanish, claimed that Spain's rank and score in the "liberal democracy index" had improved over the last year.

<table style="width:100%">
<tr>
    <td><img src="img/mejora9.png" /></td>
    <td><img src="img/mejora9en.png" /></td>

</tr>
</table>
Global Spain (and its leader, [Irene Lozano](https://twitter.com/lozanoirene)) published other tweets and graphics related to V-Dem as well. For example, several tweets pointed out that Spain's "judicial independence" was among the "top 10" in the world.

<table style="width:100%">
<tr>
    <td><img src="img/top10es.png" /></td>
    <td><img src="img/top10en.png" /></td>

</tr>
</table>
In addition to publishing on [its website](https://espanaglobal.gob.es/actualidad/sociedad/espa%C3%B1a-mejora-9-puestos-en-el-%C3%ADndice-de-democracia-de-v-dem), the official Spanish language account of "España Global" tweeted infographics and numbers, highlighting the the "improvement" from last year and the high score in "judicial independence".

<table style="width:100%">
<tr>
    <td><img src="img/indepejudes.png" /></td>
    <td><img src="img/mejoraes2.png" /></td>

</tr>
</table>
The campaign was picked up by others, too. Both private Twitter users and official government bodies like "España en la UE" tweeted about the "democratic improvements". And the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (as well as multiple politicians) retweeted.

But...
======

There's one problem with all these tweets and charts about Spain's big improvements in democratic quality and top-10 rankings in judicial independence. They're not true:

-   Spain's V-Dem score did not improve last year (in fact, it decreased slightly).
-   Spain's ranking did not change over the last year year.
-   And Spain's "judicial independence" is not ranked in the top 10 in the world by V-Dem.

It's simply false. It's a "bulo". It's "fake news"

The data
========

Global Spain either made an honest mistake, or attempted (dishonestly) to mislead about the V-Dem data. Or rather, not one mistake, but three.

Mistake 1: Spain's "Liberal Democracy Index" did not increase over the last year; it decreased.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The V-Dem has an index measure (an aggregation of other measures) which they call the "Liberal Democracy Index". According to Global Spain, this measure improved from 7,03 to 7,42 over the last year.

This is not true. The correct data are below.

![](figures/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)

The above chart shows that Spain's Liberal Democracy Index score did not improve over the last year. In fact, it got worse, going from 0.747 to 0.742.

According to Global Spain's [blog post](https://espanaglobal.gob.es/actualidad/sociedad/espa%C3%B1a-mejora-9-puestos-en-el-%C3%ADndice-de-democracia-de-v-dem) on the V-Dem data, "La consolidación democrática de España durante 40 años de Constitución es indudable" ("The democratic consolidation of Spain during the 40 years of the Constitution is beyond doubt"). However, according to the V-Dem data, Spain's most recent score is its *worse* score in 40 years, the worst score since the Constitution came into effect.

Mistake 2: No, Spain's ranking in the "Liberal Democracy Index" did not improve over last year; it remained the same
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to Global Spain, Spain improved 9 places (from 35th to 26th) in the ranking of world countries in terms of liberal democracy.

However, this is also false. Spain's rank in the 2019 report (with data collected in 2018) is 26th. Its rank the previous year was also 26th. There was no improvement.

The below is the correct data:

Mistake 3: Spain is not ranked 7th in the world in "judicial independence". It is ranked 17th or 18th.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Global Spain's Spanish-language infographic, as well as multiple tweets on the subject, it was explicitly stated that Spain was a "top 10" country in terms of "judicial independence" (see below).

<table style="width:100%">
<tr>
    <td><img src="img/b.png" /></td>
    <td><img src="img/improvements_en.png" /></td>

</tr>
</table>
This, again, is false.

There are two variables in the V-Dem which directly measure judicial independence. These are (i) `v2juhcind` (high court independence) and `v2juncind` (low court independence). In these two variables, Spain ranks 17th and 18th, respectively, not 7th. The below chart shows the correct data.
