Quantifying hypocrisy: the case of Open Arms and the Spanish Socialists
================

# Open Arms and the Socialists in 2018

The Mediterranean is, according to the [International Organization for
Migration](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants/mediterranean-by-far-worlds-deadliest-border-for-migrants-iom-idUSKBN1DO1ZY),
“by far the world’s deadliest border”. Thousands of human beings die
every year trying to reach Europe in unsafe, overcrowded boats. They
come seeking a better life for themselves and their families, often
fleeing from war, persecution, or desperate poverty.

[Open Arms](https://www.openarms.es/ca/qui-som) is an NGO dedicated to
rescuing migrants at sea. In the Mediterranean, the organization has
rescued nearly 30.000 people.

Open Arms has faced many legal and administrative challenges carrying
out its work. EU members states have been reluctant to provide safe
ports for harbor. The Italian Government - [and the Spanish
Government](https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20190703/463276395606/gobierno-espana-open-arms-multa-rescatar-migrantes.html)
- have threatened, on multiple occasions, massive fines for carrying out
rescue work.

In March 2018, for example, the vessel was [detained in
Italy](https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/03/19/inenglish/1521451743_096188.html)
for supposedly “promoting illegal immigration”. During this time, many
politicians expressed outrage. How could it be that a humanitarian
vessel dedicated to saving lives could be stuck in port for legal
reasons?

Politicians from the Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) were particularly
outraged. The PSC issued [a
statement](http://www.socialistes.cat/ca/noticia/el-psc-inicia-una-ofensiva-parlamentaria-en-suport-de-proactiva-open-arms)
declaring a “parlementary offensive in support” of Open Arms’ work.

Ferran Pedret and Meritxell Batet called on the future Catalan
government to work with the Spanish government to ensure that Open Arms
could continue its work. Javi López, the MEP of the PSC, requested
before the European Commission that the Italian Government release Open
Arms. Meritxell Batet, now Minister of Territorial Policy for the
Spanish State, pointed out that “systematic human rights violations and
abuses” were taking place in Libya, and therefore Open Arms needed a
European port. The Spanish socialists, too, spoke up on behalf of Open
Arms. Pedro Sánchez, the leader of the Socialist Party (he was not yet
president of at the time), denounced the thousands of deaths in the
Mediterranean and stated that [“The Government of Rajoy should attend to
the Open Arms boat and committ itself to a cooperation and humanitarian
poliucy worth of the
EU”](https://twitter.com/sanchezcastejon/status/984872600190021632),
[multiple
times](https://twitter.com/sanchezcastejon/status/975764844451385345).

In other words, in 2018, prior to Pedro Sánchez becoming president, and
even into the early days of his presidency, the Socialists were actively
engated in speaking out in favor of the humanitarian work being carried
out by Open Arms. Then 2019 came. And…

# Open Arms and the Socialists in 2019

In 2019, something changed. It wasn’t Open Arms, which continued its
work rescuing migrants in the Mediterranean. Rather, it was the
Socialists. In January of 2019, after Pedro Sánchez had come to power,
his government began doing exactly what the Italian government had done
in 2018 (and which the Socialists so vocally spoke out against):
[blocking Open Arms from doing its
work](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/sociedad/20190114/bloqueo-open-arms-barcelona-7244207).

And then the Socialists stopped talking about Open Arms. They did not
denounce it for supposedly violating maritime law (the excuse the
Socialist government used to block its work). They did not applaud it
for saving lives (as they had done in 2018). They simply went silent.
Completely silent.

Fast-forward to August 2019. Open Arms rescued several hundred migrants
in the Mediterranean at the beginning of the month and then floated,
aimlessly, in the Mediterranean for two weeks. No European government
would grant entry into its waters. The Socialists, now in power in
Spain, who had been so “contundent” (strong) on the issues both of (a)
applauding Open Arms and (b) not returning migrants to [Libya, where
human rights violations were taking
place](http://www.socialistes.cat/ca/noticia/el-psc-inicia-una-ofensiva-parlamentaria-en-suport-de-proactiva-open-arms),
were silent. For two weeks, as the Open Arms sought a safe port for the
hundreds of migrants aborad, the same party which only one year earlier
had declared a “parlamentary offensive” in support of Open Arms, was
completely silent.

What happened? When and why did the Socialists decided to stop
expressing solidarity with Open Arms? Who talked about Open Arms in
2018? And in 2019? Let’s dig into the data.

# Methods

The following Socialist ministers/parlamentarians were excluded, since
they don’t have publicly-known Twitter accounts:

Estrella Durá Ferrandis Fernando Grande-Marlaska Iban García del Blanco
Iratxe García Isabel García Muñoz Javier Moreno Sánchez José Guirao
Margarita Robles María Luisa Carcedo Reyes Maroto

A total of 47 accounts were examined for the entirety of 2018-2019
(through August 15), resulting in a total of 44115 tweets. A tweet was
classified as “being about Open Arms” if it contained any of the
following:

    Open Arms
    OpenArms
    open arms
    openarms

# Results

Mentions of Open Arms dropped drastically among Spanish and Catalan
Socialists from 2018 to 2019:

![](figures/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

Most Socialists did not mention Open Arms on Twitter either year. But
among those that ever mentioned Open Arms on Twitter, rates were higher
in 2018 than 2019 among all but two of the 47:

![](figures/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

In other words, despite their enthusiasm for and solidarity with Open
Arms’ work in 2018, and despite the crew and rescued individuals of Open
Arms spending the first two weeks of August in the Mediterranean with no
port, Spanish and Catalan socialists were extremely silent on the topic.

# Interpretation

Why? What happened? What compelled Spanish and Catalan socialists to be
so adamently vocal about the cause of Open Arms in 2018, and so
stunningly silent in 2019?

What compelled MEP Javi Lopez to spend [five days aboard Open Arms
in 2018](https://twitter.com/fjavilopez/status/1013172893101051904) and
to [request that the NGO be given human rights awards for its
work](https://twitter.com/fjavilopez/status/1049602644749242368) only to
say *nothing* about Open Arms during the two weeks it was without safe
harbor in August 2019?

![](img/javi.png)

Why did Socialist President of Congress nMeritxell Batet call on the
Spanish Government to take action for the cause of Open Arms when that
Spanish Government was in the hands of another party, but say nothing
about Open Arms when the Spanish Government was in the hands of her own
party?

![](img/meritxell.png)

Why did PSC President Miquel Iceta offer his “support” for the work of
Open Arms in 2018, but say nothing about Open Arms during the 2-week
period during which Spain refused to offer safe harbor?  

![](img/miquel.png)

Why did Catalan parliamentarian Pol Gibert tweet the “BackOpenArms”
hashtag from the welcoming reception for Open Arms in 2018, but say
nothing during their two weeks of peril at sea in 2019?

![](img/pol.png)

Why did Spanish Minister of Development, Jose luis Ábalos, express his
satisfaction with the rescue work of Open Arms in August 2018, but say
nothing about their work a year later, when they needed a safe port at
which to disembark?

![](img/joseluis.png)

Why did Catalan Parlamentarian Carles Castillo call the workers of Open
Arms “Heroes” in March 2018, only to sit by silently during their plight
in 2019?

![](img/carles.png)

Why did Spanish President Pedro Sánchez applaud the work of Open Arms
and call on his predecssor to “stop this drama” (in reference to not
letting Open Arms do rescue operations) in 2018, only to refuse a safe
port in 2019?

![](img/pedro.png)

Could it be that the 47 socialists examined feel that Open Arms, whose
principles many of them enthusiastically applauded in 2018, has
abandoned its principles? Could it be that they feel that the work that
Open Arms is doing is wrong?

If so, why not say that? Why not condemn Open Arms for “breaking
maritime law” or “encouraging illegal immigration”? Why not say “hey, we
were wrong in 2018, Open Arms is bad\!”? Why the silence?

I don’t know the answer to these questions. I don’t know why the
Socialists have decided to abandon Open Arms, both on Twitter and in
reality. What I *do* know is this: the high degree of uniformity in the
Socialists’ silence on the subject in 2019 is *not* suggestive of
spontaneity. Someone in the media should ask if Socialists have been
given top-down instructions not to talk about Open Arms. And if so, why?
