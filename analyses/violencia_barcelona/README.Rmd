If you are a reader of Spanish print newspapers, you might think that Barcelona erupted into a civil war this month. The headlines refer, day after day, to violent crime, homicide, robberies, riot police, and the general issue of insecurity.

Politicians, particularly those from the political right, have hopped on board as well, calling the situation in Barcelona an "emergency" and denouncing the leftist mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau.

<table style="width:100%">

So, are they right? Is the increase in cases of crime in Barcelona a reflection of reality, or of a "relat" (narrative)? Let's explore the data.

## The reality

Reliable data on crime in Barcelona are available from two sources: the Spanish Ministry of the Interior and the Catalan police (Mossos d'Esquadra). The Ministry data are likely the most comprehensive (including multiple police sources), but are only up to date through the first trimester of 2019 (and therefore largely irrelevant to the conversation about the _current_ supposed crisis in security in Barcelona). The below shows the number of crimes in Barcelona per trimester, per the Ministry of the Interior:

```{r}
ministry_chart()
```

The data from the Mossos are more detailed (by month rather than trimester) and slightly more up to date (going through the end of June). The below shows crimes known to the Mossos over the last few years.

```{r}
mossos_chart()
```

As can be seen above, there is certainly a gradual increase over time, but nothing extraordinary in the last few months. Let's look more specifically just at violent robbery (the crime that gets the most attention in the media):

```{r}
mossos_chart(robbery = T)
```

Again, there are notable increases over the last few years, but not especially in the last few months.

## The relat (the narrative)

The data on criminality is pretty straightforward: crime is going up in Barcelona, but there has been no particular change over the last few months. And even with the increases this year, Barcelona remains safter than most other European cities.

But the narrative, in both the news media and social media, is not in close contact with reality. Whereas increases in crime in Barcelona have been gradual, _talking about_ crime in Barcelona has skyrocketed over recent weeks.

For this analysis, we gathered `r nrow(newspapers_df)` tweets from `r length(newspapers)` Catalan and Spanish newspapers. The full list can be seen at the end of this article. We identified all tweets which contained both the word "Barcelona" and a word referring to violence and/or crime ("violència", "inseguretat", "delictes", "crim") in both Spanish and Catalan.

The below chart shows the combined number of monthly tweets from these `r length(newspapers)` newspapers mentioning the crime situation in Barcelona:


```{r}
newspapers_chart_simple()
```

If we look by day over just the last few weeks, the rapid increase is even more striking.

```{r}
newspapers_chart_simple(timey = 'day')
```

Let's break it down by which newspapers. 

```{r}
newspapers_chart()
```

Finally, we can examine which newspapers by day:

```{r}
newspapers_chart(timey = 'day')
```


The increased newspaper coverage has had an effect. The below shows unique tweets mentioning criminality (using the same search query as above) about Barcelona in Twitter in general.

```{r}
xarxes_chart()
```

And the below shows tweets by day mentioning violence and Barcelona.

```{r}
xarxes_chart(timey = 'day')
```
